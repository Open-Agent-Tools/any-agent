# PRD Status Legend

This document defines the status markers used throughout the PRD documentation to indicate implementation alignment.

## Status Markers

### ✅ Complete
- **Meaning**: Feature is fully implemented and working as documented
- **Usage**: Applied to sections, features, or components that match current implementation exactly
- **Example**: `### Framework Detection ✅ Complete`

### ⚠️ Misaligned
- **Meaning**: Feature exists but implementation differs significantly from documentation
- **Common Cases**:
  - Partial implementation (some features work, others don't)
  - Different approach than documented
  - Limited functionality compared to specification
  - Workarounds needed
- **Usage**: Applied when implementation exists but doesn't match spec
- **Example**: `### Multi-Protocol Support ⚠️ Misaligned - Only A2A implemented`

### ❌ Not Implemented
- **Meaning**: Feature or capability has not been implemented at all
- **Usage**: Applied to planned features, future phases, or missing components
- **Example**: `### AWS Strands Support ❌ Not Implemented`

## Section-Level Status

### High-Level Categories
- **Complete Sections**: Major functional areas fully implemented
- **Misaligned Sections**: Areas with partial or different implementation
- **Not Implemented Sections**: Planned but unbuilt capabilities

### Granular Marking
Individual features within sections are marked independently:
```markdown
### A2A Protocol Support ✅ Complete
- **A2A Protocol**: Native implementation across all frameworks ✅
- **Google ADK Integration**: Native A2A server support ✅
- **AWS Strands Integration**: Unified A2A client with streaming ✅
- **Message Format**: A2A protocol with framework-agnostic handling ✅
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Documentation Writers
1. Review implementation before marking status
2. Use most restrictive status that applies
3. Add brief explanation for ⚠️ and ❌ markers
4. Update status when implementation changes

### For Stakeholders
- **✅** = Fully functional, matches specification
- **⚠️** = Usable but with limitations or differences
- **❌** = Not available, requires development

### For Developers
- **✅** = No work needed, maintain current functionality
- **⚠️** = Needs investigation, possible refactoring required
- **❌** = New development required

## Status Summary (Current)

### ✅ Complete Areas - Fully functional
- **Google ADK framework** - Complete detection, adaptation, and A2A protocol support
- **AWS Strands framework** - Complete implementation with A2A protocol tests PASSING (3/3)
- **Framework Detection Pipeline** - LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI adapters completed
- **Agent Lifecycle Management** - Context tracking, artifact management, clean removal
- **Unified Docker Containerization** - Single generator supporting all frameworks
- **Environment Variable Management** - Priority order (CLI > agent folder > current directory)
- **A2A Protocol Implementation** - Unified a2a-sdk client using official patterns
- **CLI Interface** - Comprehensive options with framework-aware commands
- **React SPA UI** - TypeScript, Material-UI, responsive design, A2A chat integration
- **Helmsman Integration** - Deployment-time registration and discovery
- **Testing Infrastructure** - End-to-end pipeline validation for all frameworks

### ⚠️ Framework Detection Implemented (Testing in Progress)
- **LangChain** - Adapter completed, integration testing needed
- **LangGraph** - Adapter completed, integration testing needed  
- **CrewAI** - Adapter completed, integration testing needed

### ❌ Future Development Areas
- **Advanced features** - Security, monitoring, multi-tenancy
- **Cloud deployment automation** - Auto-deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Multi-architecture builds** - ARM64, multi-platform container support
- **Framework ecosystem expansion** - Additional AI agent frameworks
- **Performance optimizations** - Container startup and response time improvements
- **Planned deployment tools** - Advanced lifecycle management features

This status system provides clear visibility into what works, what has limitations, and what's still needed for complete implementation.
