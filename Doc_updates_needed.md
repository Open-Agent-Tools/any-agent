## Cross-Document Consistency Issues

### Major Inconsistencies
1. **CLI Command Format**: `any-agent` vs `python -m any_agent` used inconsistently
2. **Framework Names**: `google_adk` vs `adk`, `aws-strands` vs `strands` variations
3. **Port Numbers**: Default ports vary between 3080, 8080, and 8035 across documents
4. **Test Coverage**: Different numbers cited (338 tests vs other claims)
5. **Framework Status**: Inconsistent descriptions of what's "ready" vs "functional"

### Missing Information
1. **Installation troubleshooting**: No guidance for common installation failures
2. **Performance expectations**: Limited information on resource requirements
3. **Security considerations**: No security documentation for production deployments
